What is Data Science?\n2. The theory/concept behind Data Science and how it can be used to find answers to many difficult problems\n3. Hands on python programming\n4. Data analysis with python\n5. Data visualizations with python\n6. Machine learning with python\n\n*Note this course gives a headstart to many wonderful areas/topics in the data world and should not be treated as a full fledge specialization.\n\nYou can review the details of this course at [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science)"
